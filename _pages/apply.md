### Application and Selection Process

The studentship program is open to all current undergraduate students in the UCL Department of Neuroscience, Physiology, and Pharmacology. Prospective students should begin by approaching a PI or post-doctoral researcher within the department with a summary of their application. The PI / post-doc can then decide whether to proceed with a full application, noting that only one studentship can be awarded to each research group. Applications are prepared collaboratively between the student and PI / post-doc, and submitted directly by the PI/postdoc. Each application must include three paragraphs (max 200 words each) describing:

1: Why the student is applying to work in the specific research group
2: The skills that they will bring to that research group
3: How the studentship would align with their longer-term career goals

The selection committee will then select the top three students according to the quality of their applications. The selection committee is comprised of researchers from across the department. All unsuccessful applicants will receive feedback on how to improve their applications in future.
