## Eligibility Criteria

The studentship program is open to all second, third, or fourth year undergraduate students in the UCL Department of Neuroscience, Physiology, and Pharmacology. As such, you are ineligible to apply if you are in your first year of study (please note you are considered a first-year student during the summer after your first year at university). Please note that we will prioritise applications from those who have not previously undertaken a summer studentship.

## Preparing an Application

Prospective students should begin by approaching a [PI](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/biosciences/neuroscience-physiology-and-pharmacology/academic-staff) or [post-doctoral researcher](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/biosciences/neuroscience-physiology-and-pharmacology/postdoctoral-researchers) within the department with a summary of their application, making sure to emphasise the research skills that they can bring to the lab. The PI / post-doc then decides whether to proceed with a full application, noting that only one studentship can be awarded each year to each research group. Applications are then prepared collaboratively between the student and prospective supervisor. 

## Submitting an Application

Applications should be submitted directly by the prospective supervisor via this online form (link to appear after the 1st of April 2025).

Each application must include three paragraphs (max 200 words each) describing:

<b>[1]</b> Why the student is applying to work in the specific research group  
<b>[2]</b> The skills that they will bring to that research group  
<b>[3]</b> How the studentship would align with their longer-term career goals  

## Selection Process

Applicants will be assessed on the basis of scientific and academic merit. In the circumstances where all things are equal, priority will be given to those from groups that are currently underrepresented in the student population at UCL and/or who have come from socioeconomically deprived backgrounds, using positive action under the Equality Act 2010 where appropriate.

The selection committee is comprised of research staff from across the department. This committee will select the top three students according to the quality and clarity of their applications. All unsuccessful applicants will receive feedback on how to improve their applications in future.

Please be aware that we will collect anonymised equality, diversity and inclusion information as well as information to inform whether applicants meet any of the widening participation criteria. We will retain your personal information only for as long as is necessary, in accordance with the GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation). If we do not have any requirement to retain personal information for business, regulatory, or legal reasons, we will delete it.

## Timeline

Applications can be submitted any time from the 1st of April 2025 up to the 1st of May 2025. Students should expect to hear whether their application was successful within a fortnight of the application deadline.
