## Eligibility Criteria

The studentship program is open to all current undergraduate students in the UCL Department of Neuroscience, Physiology, and Pharmacology. 

## Submitting an Application

Prospective students should begin by approaching a [PI](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/biosciences/neuroscience-physiology-and-pharmacology/academic-staff) or [post-doctoral researcher](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/biosciences/neuroscience-physiology-and-pharmacology/postdoctoral-researchers) within the department with a summary of their application. The PI / post-doc then decides whether to proceed with a full application, noting that only one studentship can be awarded to each research group. Applications are prepared collaboratively and then submitted directly by the PI / post-doc. Each application must include three paragraphs (max 200 words each) describing:

<b>[1]</b> Why the student is applying to work in the specific research group  
<b>[2]</b> The skills that they will bring to that research group  
<b>[3]</b> How the studentship would align with their longer-term career goals  

## Selection Process

The selection committee is comprised of research staff from across the department. This committee will select the top three students according to the quality and clarity of their applications. All unsuccessful applicants will receive feedback on how to improve their applications in future.

## Timeline

The deadline for applications is the 1st of May 2025. Students should expect to hear whether their application was successful within a fortnight of the application deadline.
