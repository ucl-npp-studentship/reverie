The [UCL Department of Neuroscience, Physiology and Pharmacology](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/biosciences/neuroscience-physiology-and-pharmacology) will offer three summer studentships in 2025. These studentships are intended to provide successful applicants with hands-on experience of working in an active research group within the department. Each studentship covers six weeks of full time salary at the London Living Wage plus £500 bench fees for the host lab. Each student will present a short summary of their work at the end of the summer to their cohort and host labs, and there will be a £100 prize for the best presentation.
