The [UCL department of Neuroscience, Physiology and Pharmacology](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/biosciences/neuroscience-physiology-and-pharmacology) offers three summer studentships each year, allowing students to gain experience of working in one of the research groups within the department. Each studentship will cover six weeks of work at the London Living Wage plus bench fees.
