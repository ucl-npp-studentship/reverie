The [UCL Department of Neuroscience, Physiology and Pharmacology](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/biosciences/neuroscience-physiology-and-pharmacology) offers three summer studentships each year. These studentships are intended to provide successful applicants with experience of working in an active research group within the department. Each studentship covers six weeks of full time salary at the London Living Wage, plus bench fees (but no funding for accommodation is currently available). Each student will present a short summary of their work at the end of the summer, and there will be a prize for the best presentation.
