The [UCL Department of Neuroscience, Physiology and Pharmacology](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/biosciences/neuroscience-physiology-and-pharmacology) will offer three summer studentships in 2025. These studentships are intended to provide successful applicants with hands-on experience of working in an active research group within the department. In particular, you will gain knowledge and vocational experience that will strengthen your CV when applying for postgraduate study or subsequent employment outside of academia. Each studentship covers six weeks of full time salary at the London Living Wage plus £500 bench fees for the host lab. Studentship projects are expected to run for six continuous weeks between the 1st of July and 31st August. Each student will present a short summary of their work at the end of the summer to their cohort and host labs, and there will be a £100 prize for the best presentation.

<h2>For Prospective Supervisors</h2>

The studentship is intended to bring high quality undergraduates with valuable transferrable skills into your research group. Supervisors must commit to being available for the full duration of the studentship. Projects must be feasible for students with little or no previous research experience to complete within a 6-week placement. Projects requiring ethical approval must already have this in place at the time of application in order to be eligible for consideration. Experimentation on animals protected by UK/EU legislation should not be carried out by the student. A member of staff with the relevant license should undertake this work.

Please note that we may also have funding to supplement one externally funded summer studentship, in line with UCL's policy of paying the London living wage. Please contact either Stephanie or Dan for further information.
